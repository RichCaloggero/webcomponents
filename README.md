# Accessible Webcomponents

Here are outlines of 3 variations of the combobox theme coded as web components. Styling is minimal or nonexistant, and mouse behavior is mostly nonexistant, however all keyboard and screen reader behavior works with NVDA+Firefox (other screen reader / browser combinations may or may not work).
Clicking the links will take you to demos. Clone the repository or browse to the files on github to see the code.

- [multiselect](http://RichCaloggero.github.io/webcomponents/multiselect/demo.html)
- [autocomplete](http://RichCaloggero.github.io/webcomponents/autocomplete/demo.html)
- [tree](http://RichCaloggero.github.io/webcomponents/tree/demo.html)

These all use the aria combobox role as prescribed by aria-1.1. As such, they may not perform well in all browser / screen reader combinations.  They were written and tested with NVDA+Firefox, and thus should be evaluated using same.

See the following for a thurough description of the combobox role and current screen reader support:
